The to-do app is due on 25 November 2022, and here are the instructions:

Using  HTML, CSS and JavaScript you are going to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that helps your users keep track of various tasks. You must make effective use of Object-Oriented Programming to build your application, as a result, plan it thoroughly before you start with coding.

In order for the data, your user creates for their app experience, to persist you will need to make use of sessionStorage and/or localStorage.

When storing and creating data to be saved make sure you are using the JSON format. 

As well as your app looking beautiful and functioning as expected, at the very least it should be able to,

  

• Add tasks to the list

• Delete tasks from the list

• Edit tasks

• Add due dates to tasks

• Sort tasks alphabetically

• Strike through tasks on the list

• Save tasks in their expected states and order even after the browser has been closed

 

Commit and push regularly as we will be looking at your project's GitHub history. 

In addition to that functionality, make sure your app looks good using CSS, animation and JavaScript where necessary.

Think about what would make an app such as this useful for yourself and what will take your project above and beyond the brief within a realistic timeframe. If you don't find your own app particularly useful, chances are nor will it's users!
